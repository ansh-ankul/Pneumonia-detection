## Model Architecture

The model is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inspired by VGG-style architectures, designed for binary classification of chest X-ray images (Pneumonia vs. Normal). The network is implemented in PyTorch and processes grayscale images of size 150x150.

### Layer-by-Layer Structure

- **Input:**  
  Grayscale images of shape `(1, 150, 150)`.

- **Convolutional Blocks:**  
  The network consists of 5 sequential convolutional blocks, each with:
  - A 2D convolutional layer (`Conv2d`) with a 3x3 kernel, stride 1, and padding 1.
  - Batch normalization (`BatchNorm2d`) for regularization and faster convergence.
  - ReLU activation.
  - 2x2 max pooling (`MaxPool2d`) for spatial downsampling.

  **Filter progression:**
  - Block 1: 8 filters
  - Block 2: 8 filters
  - Block 3: 8 filters
  - Block 4: 16 filters
  - Block 5: 16 filters

- **Flatten Layer:**  
  The output from the last convolutional block is flattened into a 1D vector.

- **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers:**  
  - Dense layer with 64 units + ReLU + Dropout (p=0.6)
  - Dense layer with 32 units + ReLU + Dropout (p=0.6)
  - Output layer: Dense with 1 unit + Sigmoid activation (for binary classification)

- **Regularization:**  
  - Dropout (p=0.6) after each dense layer to prevent overfitting.
  - L2 regularization (weight decay) in the optimizer.
  - Batch normalization after each convolutional layer.

- **Loss Function:**  
  - Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (`nn.BCELoss`), with class weights to handle class imbalance.

- **Optimizer:**  
  - Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00015 and weight decay for L2 regularization.

- **Learning Rate Scheduling:**  
  - ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduces learning rate when validation loss plateaus.

- **Early Stopping:**  
  - Training stops early if validation loss does not improve for a set number of epochs (patience).

### Design Rationale

- **VGG-style blocks** are simple and effective for image classification.
- **Batch normalization** and **dropout** are used to combat overfitting, which is common in medical imaging with limited data.
- **Class weights** and **data augmentation** help address class imbalance and improve generalization.
- **Early stopping** and **learning rate scheduling** ensure efficient and robust training.
